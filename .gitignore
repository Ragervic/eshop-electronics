# User secrets (if not already handled by .vs/ or explicitly ignored)
appsettings.Development.json
appsettings.Production.json
# Or more specifically if you use user secrets directly in source control (not recommended)
# This is often managed outside of source control, e.g., for local development
# Do NOT commit sensitive keys directly. Use user secrets or environment variables.
# For actual user secrets, they usually live outside the repo, but if they get created in the project dir:
# appsettings.Development.json # If you're using this for secrets
# appsettings.Production.json # If you're using this for secrets
# It's better to manage these outside of source control or use proper secret management.

# Content for Blazor Wasm Debugging
# If you find issues with hot reload or debugging for client-side Blazor,
# sometimes specific entries might interfere. The below are usually fine.
# But if you experience problems, uncommenting these might help, though
# generally not recommended as they are part of typical build output.
